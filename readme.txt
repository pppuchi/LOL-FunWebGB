LOL Offical Cheat Dict 

idea:
In the beginning, I just wanted to practise my skills while looking for a job as Data Analyst, then I realised that the game I have played for 8 years League of Legends is a wonderful dataset since it has 159 champions and a number of data. After I downloaded and went through the file, I saw those allytips and enemytips written by Roit, which reminds me of the past happy time when playing LOL with friends. Therefore, I decided to abstract those key information, build a website and display those tiny tips on it for benefiting more people.

technical stepsï¼š
1.Download the newest documents from the official Riot website. https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol
2.Change the document format from Json to txt in order to read easily.
3.Regular expression to abstract the keywords and sentences ï¼ˆid, title, name, allytips, enemytipsï¼‰.
4.Use python to delete all the other pictures except the origin for every champion.
5.Find a good-looking website template
6.Use python to produce html code chunks
7.Modify the website contents and details
8.Upload to github and deploy website

problems:
1. I thought to keep the smallest pic for saving the space and it turned out the difference can be ignored, therefore, for best identification, I decided to keep the origins instead of the skill pics.
2.When programming with python,   \ should be paid attention. However, windows can recognise even there are 2\ in address.
3.The ?(greedy & ungreedy) in the regular expression wasted me 2 hours.ðŸ˜€
4.Some champs' allytips and enemytips are missing, I filled in "Waiting for update".

You may want to know:
1.When i was learning website programming, i used dreamweaver and visual studio. But neither of them is in my new pc so i just used notepad to edit the website file.
2.From having the idea and website finished, it took me a whole afternoon.
3.Hope Riot can work with font awesome to make a unique logo, could be either the fist or the map of LOL.

thanks to html5up for the free website template.
thank Alex The Analyst for showing me how to deploy a website on github for free.
